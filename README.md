*COMP30022 IT Project 2021 Sem2*
## The Capstone Project Repository of Team 28 (Apex Predator)

This project runs through the entire semester of our team, which asks us, based on several requirements made by the client, to design and build a CRM system that is orientated to university students for contacts managing and task recording. The project aims to help us to gain a more explicit understanding and view of IT principles and practice the culture of teamwork.
